# AT200PC WebControl

This project is an remote control to LDG electronics AT200PC auto tuner.

AT200PC is a HF antenna auto tuner that was made to be controled by a RS232 interface with a normal PC. But in my station the tuner was instaled on a external box to be closer to the antenna. Now with this software and hardware I can control the tuner via any web browser, and also read the tuner outputs like power ans SWR.

todo list:
 1 - Better web interface
 2 - Configure wifi via web
